## useReducer

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

The useReducer hook is usually recommended when the state becomes complex, with state values depending on each other or when the next state depends on the previous one. However, many times you can simply bundle your separate useState statements into one object and continue to use useState.
